# Perplexity Clone

Perplexity Clone is an AI-powered search application inspired by Perplexity.ai. It allows users to ask questions and get intelligent responses. The project consists of a **Flutter frontend** and a **Fastrack Python backend** implemented based on Ranavt's YouTube tutorial.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Implemented Features
- **Home Page Search**: Users can search for queries on the home page.
- **Backend Logic**: Built using **Fastrack Python**, inspired by Ranavt's tutorial.
- **Navigation**: The app has four main pages:
    - 🏠 **Home** (Search working)
    - 🔎 **Discover** (UI ready, backend not integrated yet)
    - 📚 **Library** (UI ready, backend not integrated yet)
    - 🌍 **Spaces** (UI ready, backend not integrated yet)

### 🛠️ Features in Progress
- Enabling search functionality across **Discover, Library, and Spaces** pages.
- Enhancing response formatting for better user experience.
- Adding user authentication and saved searches.
